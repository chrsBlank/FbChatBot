DUE TO FACEBOOK CHANGES IN API THIS IS NO LONGER WORKING.

Since i do not use facebook anymore, i will not continue this project except if someone is willing to collaborate on it

You need to pip install the following
        -> fbchat , pip3 install fbchat
        ->pushbullet.pushbullet , https://github.com/rbrcsk/pushbullet.py (you will get it from here)

You need to change some of the strings i have left with comments, eg "YOUR API KEY" , and replace them with your stuff
Replace the strings with what you want, put your pass and email and you are good to go.
